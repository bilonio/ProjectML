# Machine Learning Course Project  
=================================  

This project includes four exercises aimed at applying different machine learning techniques to solve classification problems.  
The tasks include Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian inference, Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, and applying the best algorithm for classification.  
Below is a detailed description of each exercise.
