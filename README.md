# Machine Learning Course Project  

This project includes four exercises aimed at applying different machine learning techniques to solve classification problems. The tasks include Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Bayesian inference, Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, and applying the best algorithm for classification. Below is a detailed description of each exercise.  

## How to run the code  
1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/bilonio/ProjectML.git  
2. Install required dependencies  
For virtualenv:
pip install -r requirements.txt  
For conda environment:  
conda env create -f environment.yml  
3. Run each exercise notebook or script to execute the corresponding task.
